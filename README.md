# GOG Task Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for the GOG data pipeline task, including table design, data cleaning procedures, and analytical insights.

## 1. Data Model Design

### Staging Layer
- **Table Creation**: Implemented staging tables with comprehensive data cleaning
- **Data Processing**: Applied trimming and normalization procedures with explicit type casting to ensure proper data structure

### Data Mart Layer
- **dim_games**: 
  - Surrogate key generated in the staging layer as new id
  - Remaining attributes preserved as-is, original game_id was preserved but under alias
  - Note: In production environments, developer information would typically be stored in a separate dimension table
  
- **fact_daily_revenue**: 
  - Surrogate key generated in the staging layer
  - Invalid game entries filtered out during staging
  - Transactions without exchange rates excluded from the final mart

## 2. Additional Analysis

### Exchange Rate Analysis
Located in the `analyses` folder:
- **missing_exchange_rate_for_trans**: Identifies transactions lacking exchange rate data
- **Finding**: Exchange rates are missing for several transaction entries, which may indicate data quality issues when only rate changes are provided in source systems

## 3. Data Reconciliation

### raw_transactions vs psp_transactions
This reconciliation logic was strategically placed in the fact table layer rather than the analyses folder. This decision was based on the business value of this data for future analytical purposes, specifically to identify which game categories experience payment processing issues.
